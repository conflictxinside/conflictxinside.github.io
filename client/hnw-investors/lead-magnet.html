                <p class="mb-3">
                    If you’re within 5 years of retirement, you’re in a critical period – if you take action now, you may still be able to make up for past mistakes. The decisions you make now will define your retirement lifestyle and your ability to retire successfully. This checklist is designed to highlight your strengths and weaknesses for retirement preparation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go through each step of this checklist and take action. As you go, jot down any questions or concerns you may have and send them to me <a href = "#">here</a>. If you’re feeling overwhelmed and want some pro guidance, give my office a call to schedule a chat at the number below.

        <p>You might be thinking to yourself: this is too overwhelming to deal with right now. Before you set this checklist aside for later, I want to remind you of something: you’ve already made the decision to take action. The first step is the hardest, and you’ve already taken it. Just taking that step puts you much farther ahead than most people.</p>
        <p>It’s okay not to have all the answers to the questions presented in this checklist. What’s important is identifying where you still need to take action. If you need some advice or encouragement, please call my office to schedule a chat.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">Even if you feel comfortable with your current retirement plan, I’d recommend getting a professional to find out if the changes from the new retirement regulations impact your current strategy.</p>
