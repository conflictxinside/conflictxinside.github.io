        <p>Plain vanilla solutions might work for those with less complex needs. <strong>However, you’re at the point where you need more advanced strategies.</strong></p>
        <p>And you’re pretty sure that professionals working with immensely wealthy investors aren’t telling them to skip avocado toast and coffee shop lattes just to save a few pennies.</p>

        <p><strong>Right now, you may be asking yourself questions like these:</strong></p>

          <li>Is my current strategy missing anything that would help me optimize what I’ve already accumulated?</li>
          <li>What opportunities are right around the corner?</li>
          <li>Am I protecting against the most likely risks?</li>
          <li>What happens if I don’t make the right decisions in time?</li>
          <li>Do I have a trusted resource to review all I’ve done so far and give me constructive feedback?</li>

              INGREDIENT #1
              <span class="d-block">Minimizing Taxes (As Much As Possible)</span>
            </h2>
            <p>While it’s true that paying taxes is one of the two sure things in this world, the amount that you’re legally required to send to Uncle Sam isn’t set in stone. Taking steps to potentially lower your exposure to high marginal tax rates is key to keeping more of your money working for you.</p>
            <p><strong>Maximizing your tax-deferred savings is one technique to potentially help reduce your taxable income now.</strong> Your retirement plan is fundamental to your financial success, especially an employer-sponsored plan that allows you to sock away tax-deferred savings.</p>
            <p><strong>Another strategy used by savvy investors is changing the nature of their income to capital gains wherever possible.</strong> Long-term capital gains tax rates have historically been lower than income tax rates.<sup>1</sup> </p>
            <p><strong>Investors with complex compensation arrangements can also potentially benefit from deferring compensation to future years, allowing them to control the tax consequences.</strong></p>
            <p>Tax-smart asset allocation can also help reduce your tax liability by putting the right investments in the right taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free “buckets”.</p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental tax minimization questions to ask include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Does my compensation package provide more benefits that could help me lower my taxes?</li>
              <li>Have I explored all the options available to me for reducing my tax exposure?</li>
              <li>Am I aware of all the tax consequences of the investment choices I make?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I asked for an objective view of my total tax picture from a professional?</strong></li>
            </ul>

              INGREDIENT #2
              <span class="d-block">Crafting Your Health Care Elixir</span>
            </h2>
            <p>One of the most expensive puzzles in retirement is paying for health care. Unfortunately these costs have been on the rise faster than average inflation for years.<sup>2</sup> </p>
            <p><strong>Ensuring that unexpected health issues don’t undermine your financial strategy is another key ingredient to a successful financial strategy.</strong></p>
            <p>It’s important to understand what Medicare pays for once you’re 65, and how it coordinates with your current employer’s coverage. Assuming, of course, that you still have access to that coverage at retirement.</p>
            <p>How will you pay for the things that Medicare doesn’t cover, such as long-term care, dental, and vision? Will you self-insure or seek out supplemental coverage? </p>
            <p>However, when it comes to long-term care when you can’t feed or dress yourself, you’re on your own to fund it under current laws. Advanced health care strategies such as long-term care insurance could help cover costs if you have a family history of needing care or you’re concerned about out-of-pocket costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental questions to ask about your health care needs include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What kind of health care coverage will I have in my senior years?</li>
              <li>Do I understand all the options for funding my health care needs in retirement?</li>
              <li>Am I likely to need long-term care in the future, and if so, how will I pay for it?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I discussed the rising costs of health care and how to account for them with a professional?</strong></li>
            </ul>

              <span class="d-block">Properly Positioning Your Portfolio</span>
            </h2>
            <p>In the old days, investors could rely on interest income in retirement. The old adage that retirees lived by was <strong>“Never touch the principal.”</strong></p>
            <p>Unfortunately, while double-digit interest rates provide a healthy income, today’s lower rates may not. Especially when combined with longer, healthier lifespans.</p>
            <p><strong>That makes a modern portfolio strategy that’s allocated the right way more important than ever. It needs to give you enough growth to fight back against inflation while not taking on too much risk in uncertain markets.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>If your net worth is at least $1 million (not including the value of your home), you may be missing out on more advanced strategies available to you.</strong> The details of your personal situation make a big difference so asking the right questions and getting professional advice is critical to making the most of potential opportunities.</p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental questions to ask about my portfolio include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do I understand the risks my portfolio faces now and in the near term?</li>
              <li>Have I found a balance between my needs now and in the future?</li>
              <li>Am I keeping an eye on the serious risks that could hurt my portfolio?</li>
              <li>Am I taking advantage of all the opportunities available to me as an investor?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I consulted a financial professional on whether my portfolio has the right mix of assets?</strong></li>

            </h2>
            <p>Once you start amassing significant assets, the money is often held by more than one manager. If you have a 401(k) or similar retirement account, it’s typically managed alongside everyone else in the company, regardless of your personal needs. </p>
            <p>In addition, you might have retirement plans from previous employers, and individual retirement accounts, plus a taxable investment account or two. </p>
            <p>Spreading your investments across a variety of managers and institutions doesn’t always benefit you as an investor. Each professional sees only their piece of the pie. </p>
            <p>Without that global view, conflicting strategies could detract from portfolio value instead of enhancing it. Even if you’re managing your investments yourself.</p>
            <p>Are you missing some key strategies or assets that might benefit you? Are you too concentrated in other areas?</p>
            <p>A complete and objective perspective tells you when your portfolio is out of balance.</p>
            <p><strong>We know that too much ice waters down a cocktail, and investing too much in one asset can dilute the performance of the whole portfolio.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental questions about my overall strategy include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do I have the right balance of assets to maximize the return for the amount of risk I’m willing to take?</li>
              <li>Do I know how much risk I can take?</li>
              <li>Am I able to view the whole portfolio objectively and determine whether I need to make adjustments?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I talked to a financial professional about whether my portfolio is greater than the sum of its parts, or something less?</strong></li>
