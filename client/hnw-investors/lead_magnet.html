              INGREDIENT #1
              <span class="d-block">Minimizing Taxes (As Much As Possible)</span>
            </h2>
            <p>While it’s true that paying taxes is one of the two sure things in this world, the amount that you’re legally required to send to Uncle Sam isn’t set in stone. Taking steps to potentially lower your exposure to high marginal tax rates is key to keeping more of your money working for you.</p>
            <p><strong>Maximizing your tax-deferred savings is one technique to potentially help reduce your taxable income now.</strong> Your retirement plan is fundamental to your financial success, especially an employer-sponsored plan that allows you to sock away tax-deferred savings.</p>
            <p><strong>Another strategy used by savvy investors is changing the nature of their income to capital gains wherever possible.</strong> Long-term capital gains tax rates have historically been lower than income tax rates.1 </p>
            <p><strong>Investors with complex compensation arrangements can also potentially benefit from deferring compensation to future years, allowing them to control the tax consequences.</strong></p>
            <p>Tax-smart asset allocation can also help reduce your tax liability by putting the right investments in the right taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free “buckets”.</p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental tax minimization questions to ask include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Does my compensation package provide more benefits that could help me lower my taxes?</li>
              <li>Have I explored all the options available to me for reducing my tax exposure?</li>
              <li>Am I aware of all the tax consequences of the investment choices I make?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I asked for an objective view of my total tax picture from a professional?</strong></li>
            </ul>

              INGREDIENT #2
              <span class="d-block">Crafting Your Health Care Elixir</span>
            </h2>
            <p>One of the most expensive puzzles in retirement is paying for health care. Unfortunately these costs have been on the rise faster than average inflation for years.2 </p>
            <p><strong>Ensuring that unexpected health issues don’t undermine your financial strategy is another key ingredient to a successful financial strategy.</strong></p>
            <p>It’s important to understand what Medicare pays for once you’re 65, and how it coordinates with your current employer’s coverage. Assuming, of course, that you still have access to that coverage at retirement.</p>
            <p>How will you pay for the things that Medicare doesn’t cover, such as long-term care, dental, and vision? Will you self-insure or seek out supplemental coverage? </p>
            <p>However, when it comes to long-term care when you can’t feed or dress yourself, you’re on your own to fund it under current laws. Advanced health care strategies such as long-term care insurance could help cover costs if you have a family history of needing care or you’re concerned about out-of-pocket costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental questions to ask about your health care needs include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What kind of health care coverage will I have in my senior years?</li>
              <li>Do I understand all the options for funding my health care needs in retirement?</li>
              <li>Am I likely to need long-term care in the future, and if so, how will I pay for it?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I discussed the rising costs of health care and how to account for them with a professional?</strong></li>
            </ul>
