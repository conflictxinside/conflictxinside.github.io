            </h2>
            <p>While it’s true that paying taxes is one of the two sure things in this world, the amount that you’re legally required to send to Uncle Sam isn’t set in stone. Taking steps to potentially lower your exposure to high marginal tax rates is key to keeping more of your money working for you.</p>
            <p><strong>Maximizing your tax-deferred savings is one technique to potentially help reduce your taxable income now.</strong> Your retirement plan is fundamental to your financial success, especially an employer-sponsored plan that allows you to sock away tax-deferred savings.</p>
            <p><strong>Another strategy used by savvy investors is changing the nature of their income to capital gains wherever possible.</strong> Long-term capital gains tax rates have historically been lower than income tax rates.1 </p>
            <p><strong>Investors with complex compensation arrangements can also potentially benefit from deferring compensation to future years, allowing them to control the tax consequences.</strong></p>
            <p>Tax-smart asset allocation can also help reduce your tax liability by putting the right investments in the right taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free “buckets”.</p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental tax minimization questions to ask include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Does my compensation package provide more benefits that could help me lower my taxes?</li>
              <li>Have I explored all the options available to me for reducing my tax exposure?</li>
              <li>Am I aware of all the tax consequences of the investment choices I make?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I asked for an objective view of my total tax picture from a professional?</strong></li>
            </ul>

              <p>Even with government programs such as Social Security and Medicare, the costs of living as an elder adult can come on suddenly and all at once. In fact, nearly a quarter of Medicare costs are spent in the last year of life.<sup>3</sup> For example, the median cost of a nursing home is over $90,000 per year—and could be much higher depending on where you get care.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p>What are the expenses? Even if you plan to remain in your home to avoid the high costs of a care community, you’ll need to prepare your home for aging in place. This could mean renovations to the house, such as:</p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Widening doorways (average installation cost $1,100, up to $40,000 if structural changes are needed)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Installing wheelchair ramps (average cost $1,100)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Walk-in bathtubs (average installation cost $5,000, up to $15,000)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Bathroom remodel (average cost $14,000, up to $24,800)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Non-slip flooring (average cost $8,000, up to $11,000)</strong></li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p><em>All costs courtesy of Retirement Living.<sup>5</sup></em></p>
              <p>You’ll also need to hire people for home upkeep and maintenance when you’re no longer capable of doing it yourself. Maintenance costs on a home alone, not including labor, can run from 1–4% of your home’s value.<sup>6</sup></p>
              <p><strong>Home help comes with a hefty price tag.</strong> The median cost of a home health aide is about $52,600 annually for 44 hours a week of help.<sup>7</sup> Plus, you may suddenly find yourself needing more care that can only be addressed by moving into a nursing home or assisted living. The cost of memory care, should you need it, adds an additional layer of expenses. </p>
              <p><strong>Any of these expenses will significantly raise your cost of living and threaten your long-term financial security.</strong></p>

              <p>When it comes to paying for long-term care, a number of options are available to those who are currently healthy. But you may not be eligible for them past a certain age, or once certain illnesses have occurred. In fact, folks age 60–69 have a 30% chance of being denied for long-term care coverage.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p>One common choice for covering care costs is to self-insure, or pay the expenses out of pocket. The risk is that you will run out of money or hurt your spouse’s lifestyle. It’s sadly common for children to receive diminished legacies or none at all, because the money was spent on the parent’s care.</p>
              <p>An alternative to that is to buy a traditional long-term care insurance (LTCI) policy. It’s specifically designed to cover just your long-term care needs. However, if you buy it and never use it, in most cases you will not receive a refund; these types of contracts are “use it or lose it.”</p>
              <p>Another option is to buy what’s called an asset-based policy, typically a life insurance or annuity contract with a long-term care rider. Each insurance company structures them somewhat differently. In general, though, the amount paid for your long-term care is subtracted from the benefit you would otherwise receive from the contract.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: you’ve got options, <span class="d-md-block">especially if you start planning early.</span></p>
