      <p>If you’ve ever had to watch a loved one lose their capacity for living independently, you know how difficult it is for the whole family. Becoming impaired often starts with unexpected challenges&hellip;</p>
        <p>Like the inability to stand up after using the bathroom or to simply get out of bed. Over time, it gets worse.</p>
        <p>All too often, struggles with the normal activities of daily living are accompanied by the loss of dignity and rapid depletion of savings. You need assistance but might not want members of your family to handle more delicate tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Here’s the hard truth: hiring help for your “long-term care” is not covered by Medicare, nor by most employer or retiree health plans.</strong></p>
        <p>Help does not come cheap, especially when it’s all out-of-pocket. Many folks prefer to stay in their familiar home for as long as possible. Whether you’re cared for at a facility or at home, the expenses add up.</p>
        <p>It’s expected that about one in four people who are now age 65 will face $50,000 or more in long-term care costs that are not covered by a health care plan.<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p><strong>If you’ve helped a relative through the process, you probably want to avoid the stress and loss of dignity that come with having your spouse and kids (or others) make decisions for you.</strong></p>

              <p>Even with government programs such as Social Security and Medicare, the costs of living as an elder adult can come on suddenly and all at once. In fact, nearly a quarter of Medicare costs are spent in the last year of life.<sup>3</sup> For example, the median cost of a nursing home is over $90,000 per year—and could be much higher depending on where you get care.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p>What are the expenses? Even if you plan to remain in your home to avoid the high costs of a care community, you’ll need to prepare your home for aging in place. This could mean renovations to the house, such as:</p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Widening doorways (average installation cost $1,100, up to $40,000 if structural changes are needed)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Installing wheelchair ramps (average cost $1,100)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Walk-in bathtubs (average installation cost $5,000, up to $15,000)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Bathroom remodel (average cost $14,000, up to $24,800)</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Non-slip flooring (average cost $8,000, up to $11,000)</strong></li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p><em>All costs courtesy of Retirement Living.<sup>5</sup></em></p>
              <p>You’ll also need to hire people for home upkeep and maintenance when you’re no longer capable of doing it yourself. Maintenance costs on a home alone, not including labor, can run from 1–4% of your home’s value.<sup>6</sup></p>
              <p><strong>Home help comes with a hefty price tag.</strong> The median cost of a home health aide is about $52,600 annually for 44 hours a week of help.<sup>7</sup> Plus, you may suddenly find yourself needing more care that can only be addressed by moving into a nursing home or assisted living. The cost of memory care, should you need it, adds an additional layer of expenses. </p>
              <p><strong>Any of these expenses will significantly raise your cost of living and threaten your long-term financial security.</strong></p>

              <p>When it comes to paying for long-term care, a number of options are available to those who are currently healthy. But you may not be eligible for them past a certain age, or once certain illnesses have occurred. In fact, folks age 60–69 have a 30% chance of being denied for long-term care coverage.<sup>4</sup></p>
              <p>One common choice for covering care costs is to self-insure, or pay the expenses out of pocket. The risk is that you will run out of money or hurt your spouse’s lifestyle. It’s sadly common for children to receive diminished legacies or none at all, because the money was spent on the parent’s care.</p>
              <p>An alternative to that is to buy a traditional long-term care insurance (LTCI) policy. It’s specifically designed to cover just your long-term care needs. However, if you buy it and never use it, in most cases you will not receive a refund; these types of contracts are “use it or lose it.”</p>
              <p>Another option is to buy what’s called an asset-based policy, typically a life insurance or annuity contract with a long-term care rider. Each insurance company structures them somewhat differently. In general, though, the amount paid for your long-term care is subtracted from the benefit you would otherwise receive from the contract.</p>
              <p>Bottom line: you’ve got options, <span class="d-md-block">especially if you start planning early.</span></p>
