        <p>What is it about your favorite cocktail that makes it perfect for you?</p>
        <p>You could sit down at the bar and order the same thing as the person sitting next to you.</p>
        <p>But you don’t. </p>
        <p>You order the drink that fits your specific taste. Your mood. </p>
        <p>The distinct aromas, perfect temperature, and hand-selected ingredients have been meticulously engineered to please your taste buds. </p>
        <p>And you’ve likely tweaked it here and there over the course of your life as your tastes have changed.</p>
        <p><strong>Why shouldn’t your portfolio be concocted with the same personalized attention to detail?</strong> If a few ounces of liquid can be mixed with precision to suit your taste, surely the money that you’ve worked so diligently to acquire and invest can be customized to meet your exact needs. </p>
        <p>You can certainly find plenty of financial information online, but how much of it applies to your particular situation? </p>
        <p>Plain vanilla solutions might work for those with less complex needs. <strong>However, you’re at the point where you need more advanced strategies.</strong></p>
        <p>And you’re pretty sure that professionals working with immensely wealthy investors aren’t telling them to skip avocado toast and coffee shop lattes just to save a few pennies.</p>
        <p><strong>Now is the time to discover the ingredients you’ll need and the tools that will allow you to craft a personalized strategy to manage your wealth as effectively as possible.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Right now, you may be asking yourself questions like these:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is my current strategy missing anything that would help me optimize what I’ve already accumulated?</li>
          <li>What opportunities are right around the corner?</li>
          <li>Am I protecting against the most likely risks?</li>
          <li>What happens if I don’t make the right decisions in time?</li>
          <li>Do I have a trusted resource to review all I’ve done so far and give me constructive feedback?</li>

              <span class="d-block">Minimizing Taxes (As Much As Possible)</span>
            </h2>
            <p>While it’s true that paying taxes is one of the two sure things in this world, the amount that you’re legally required to send to Uncle Sam isn’t set in stone. Taking steps to potentially lower your exposure to high marginal tax rates is key to keeping more of your money working for you.</p>
            <p><strong>Maximizing your tax-deferred savings is one technique to potentially help reduce your taxable income now.</strong> Your retirement plan is fundamental to your financial success, especially an employer-sponsored plan that allows you to sock away tax-deferred savings.</p>
            <p><strong>Another strategy used by savvy investors is changing the nature of their income to capital gains wherever possible.</strong> Long-term capital gains tax rates have historically been lower than income tax rates.1 </p>
            <p><strong>Investors with complex compensation arrangements can also potentially benefit from deferring compensation to future years, allowing them to control the tax consequences.</strong></p>
            <p>Tax-smart asset allocation can also help reduce your tax liability by putting the right investments in the right taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free “buckets”.</p>
            <p><strong>Fundamental tax minimization questions to ask include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Does my compensation package provide more benefits that could help me lower my taxes?</li>
              <li>Have I explored all the options available to me for reducing my tax exposure?</li>
              <li>Am I aware of all the tax consequences of the investment choices I make?</li>
              <li><strong>Have I asked for an objective view of my total tax picture from a professional?</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any of these questions resonate with you, keep reading...</p>
