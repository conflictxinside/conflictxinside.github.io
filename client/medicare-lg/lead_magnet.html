                    <p>Whether you’re looking into Medicare for the first time, or taking advantage of annual enrollment to update your strategy, we’ve broken down the critical choices you must make into a simple decision-making tool (including the easy-to-understand questions you MUST ask yourself before choosing a plan).</p>
                    <p>Getting the answers wrong can cost you big-time! Not only is health care likely to be your largest expense in your retirement (potentially $300,000 or more), but nearly every American over age 65 must eventually enroll in Medicare.<sup>1</sup></p>
                    <p>Making the wrong choices could cost you thousands in permanent penalties, leave you facing high medical bills without coverage, or force you into a too-expensive plan.</p>
                    <p>In the following pages, I’ll walk you step-by-step through a shockingly simple set of questions to help you choose a Medicare plan. By virtue of its simplicity, this decision-making tool leaves out most of the nitty gritty.</p>

            <h2>When To Enroll</h2>
            <h3><strong>Do I need to enroll in Medicare?</strong> Key questions to help guide your decision:</h3>
            <p><strong>​​Are you at least 65?</strong> Unless you qualify for disability, you typically don’t qualify for Medicare until age 65. There are some exceptions to that rule, so if you have questions about your eligibility, book a free chat with me to discuss. We’ll help you determine exactly when you need to enroll in Medicare.</p>
            <p><strong>Are you covered by employer-sponsored or retiree health insurance?</strong> If so, and your employer has at least 20 employees, you may not need to enroll in Medicare yet.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you qualify for VA benefits or TriCare?</strong> If so, you may still need to enroll in Medicare Part B because VA and Medicare benefits do not overlap.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning!</strong> If you are eligible for Medicare coverage and are not covered by qualifying insurance, you should consider enrolling in Medicare ASAP to avoid late enrollment penalties and higher premium costs.</p>
            <p class="fancy">Now, let’s talk about which Medicare strategy might be right for you...</p>

                    <li>I already have doctors and specialists, and don’t want to switch.</li>
                    <li>I travel away from home and want coverage that spans the entire United States.</li>

                  <p>Part A covers hospitals, rehab, and hospice care, whereas Part B covers doctor visits, lab tests, screenings, and other outpatient services. While Part A is free for most people, you’ll pay monthly premiums for Part B plus deductibles, copays, and coinsurance.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> You have the freedom to visit any provider or hospital in the U.S. that participates in Medicare and don’t need to work with a primary care physician to see specialists. This flexibility is ideal if you travel outside of your home network or have existing relationships with doctors you want to keep.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Services have deductibles and copays, which may require you to purchase a Medigap or Medicare Supplement Plan to control your out-of-pocket spending. You will also need to purchase prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D) separately.</p>

                  <p>Offered through private insurers, Part C is often structured like an HMO or PPO and provides comprehensive health coverage combining Parts A and B.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Many Part C plans cover extra services like vision, hearing, and dental and may include prescription drug coverage. Plans have an annual limit on your total out-of-pocket costs.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> In addition to paying a part B premium, you’ll typically pay an extra monthly premium for the Medicare Advantage plan. Networks change, doctors can leave, and benefits can change over time.</p>

                  <p>You’ll need to sign up as soon as you become eligible for Medicare, even if you don’t use prescription drugs, to avoid paying late enrollment penalties.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Copays and other plan details vary by state and insurer, but they will cover most of the cost of your prescriptions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cons:</strong> After exceeding coverage limits, you’ll pay the full cost of your medications until a Medicare threshold is reached.</p>

                  <p>What is it? Private insurance that fills the coverage gaps in Parts A and B of Medicare and helps with deductibles, copays, coinsurance, etc.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pros:</strong> It limits your out-of-pocket costs for Original Medicare.</p>
